⏱️ Timestamp generation for key moments in the video.

📄 Uses youtube-transcript-api to extract video transcripts.

🧠 Allows users to choose between AI models (Gemini, ChatGPT, DeepSeek).

⏩ Saves time by delivering key insights quickly and effectively.

📋 Built-in clipboard copy functionality for all generated content.

📥 Transcript download support.
